ScrollingMenu
=============

A sliding level selector menu for SpriteKit iOS 7 games with a scrolling parallax background

Many games have a sliding page selector to select a level to play. Here is one built for SpriteKit that doesn't use an UIScrollView and has a parallax backgound behind the menu.

Levels and Worlds are loaded from plists within the project.

you can swap the parlallax images with any image you want of any size, but they must have a numbering suffix of 4 digits (0001) if you use different image prefixes that I have setup in the project just change the prefix to the load parallax method in the code.

If you don't understand anything shoot me a questions and I will be happy to try and help out.
